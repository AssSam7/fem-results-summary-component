# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component

![Design preview for the Results summary component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## Challenge

The challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

User Features:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Solution Approach

As this is a straightforward component, I have chosen to stick without using any library/framework approach with pure CSS, and Javascript. Although, I have used the CSS pre-processor SCSS for the styling of the application.
